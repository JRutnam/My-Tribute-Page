    <h3 id="headline">Trivium, who they are and why I love their music</h3>
    <ul>
      <li> Trivium are a North American heavy metal band, that first formed in Orlando Florida in 1999.</li>
      <li> Current Frontman Matt Heafy was first brought in to the band as a lead guitarist in 1999, at the age of only 13.
      </li>
      <li> Arguably the most recognisable line up of Trivium was from 2004 - 2010, the only difference from their current line up being founding member Travis Smith on the drums
      </li>
      <li> Long time followers and fans of Trivium will be well aware of the bands evolving musical style. Something that can be attributed to their ongoing success on the world stage. </li>
      </li> Personally I believe the 2015 album <strong> Until the world goes cold </strong> and the 2017 album <strong> The sin and the sentence </strong> truely capture the essence of Trivium and demonstrate why they have continued to be successful at creating a universally pleasing sound
     </ul>
  <h4> 5 songs I would recommend to any new listener </h4>
  <ul>
  <li> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0dD59FYxJ4">Pull harder on the strings of your martyr</a> </li>
  <li> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnnd2uEi-dU">Shogun</a>
    <li> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Xfvk028Kv0">In Waves</a>
    <li> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EApnhO2OIrw">Down from the Sky</a>
    <li> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fwr1Z7uyXz4">The Heart from your hate</a>
    </ul>
  <p> Overall as a heavy metal fan, or simply a fan of well composed and well written songs. In my opinion Trivium have something to offer every music listener and I would highly recommend listening to them </p>
